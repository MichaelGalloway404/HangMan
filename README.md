# Hang Man Game
Simple hang man game, using only Javascript.  
This was one of a few projects I worked on while taking some of my easeir gen-ed classes at Eastern Oregon University in my spare time I was learning and playing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  
I compiled a set of random words from the internet, hopefuly you dont get a word for a soluble fiber components of corn or other large terms, but hey a little difficulty can be fun.  

The animations are drawn by me and it works great on any device.  
Points are not deducted for clicking the same letter twice.  
The interface consist of buttons for each letter you wish to guess.
