# Hang Man Game
Simple hang man game, using only Javascript.  
This was one of a few projects I worked on while taking some of my easier gen-ed classes at Eastern Oregon University in my spare time I was learning and playing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  
I compiled a set of random words from the internet, hopefully you don't get a word for a soluble fiber component of corn or other large terms, but hey a little difficulty can be fun.  

The animations are drawn by me, and it works great on any device.  
Points are not deducted for clicking the same letter twice.  
The interface consists of buttons for each letter you wish to guess.
